## About The Project

Soundsaver was created as a solution to a problem many Soundcloud listeners face: Unexpected song deletion.

The main goal with Soundsaver is to help users track their liked songs and display the songs that have dissapeared from their library.
This tool is especially useful for users that want to search for another upload of the song that was deleted and add it back to their library.


Site Features:
* Feature that checks which songs have been deleted since the last scan
* Song search filter
* Secure login and authentication


### Built With

* React.js + Vite
* Express.js
* PostgreSQL
* soundcloud.ts
* Supabase

## Upcoming Features

* Song downloads
* A search function that suggests songs based on missing tracks
